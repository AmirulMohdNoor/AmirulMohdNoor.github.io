## About Me

Hello! I'm **Amirul**, hailing from the vibrant country of Malaysia. I graduated with a Bachelor of Information Technology, specializing in Networking Technology, from Universiti Islam Selangor.

### My Passion for Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity isn't just a profession for meâ€”it's a passion. I am particularly fascinated with the world of **offensive security**. The thrill of uncovering vulnerabilities and enhancing network defenses drives my pursuit for knowledge in this field.

### CTF Enthusiast

Beyond the professional sphere, I am an avid **CTF (Capture The Flag) player**. These competitions are not just games for me; they are a battleground where I sharpen my skills in real-world cybersecurity scenarios.
